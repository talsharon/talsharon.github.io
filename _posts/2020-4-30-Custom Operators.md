title: Custom Operators ðŸ¥³
---

Swift lets us easily define custom operators. I am going to demonstrate how it is done using a simple use case - managing views and layouting them.

# ðŸ’¯

### Simplifying code

Manipulating views in code usually invloves a lot of boiler plate code. We have to think about dimensions, frames, or constraints. Apple doesn't give us a break here, as auto layout API offered by UIKit is not trivial and not very natural.
Lucky for us, we could make it better by using custom operators!  
Consider the following code:

```swift

  let parent = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)) // 1
  let child1 = UIView()
  let child2 = UIView()
  let child3 = UIView()
  
  parent.addSubview(child1) // 2
  child1.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false // 3
  child1.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true // 4
  child1.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true
  child1.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.topAnchor).isActive = true
  child1.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
  
  parent.addSubview(child2)
  child2.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
  child2.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 40).isActive = true
  child2.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30).isActive = true
  child2.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.topAnchor).isActive = true
  child2.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.leadingAnchor).isActive = true
  
  parent.addSubview(child3)
  child3.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
  child3.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 20).isActive = true
  child3.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.topAnchor).isActive = true
  child3.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
  child3.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parent.leadingAnchor).isActive = true

```

See how much boiler plate code we have to use in order to setup UI elements programatcially:
1. We have to create views with explicit frames and dimensions.
2. We have to add views to other views.
3. Since we want to use UIKit auto layout constraints, we need to tell views not to deduce implicit constraints based on the initial frame.
4. We have to add layout constraints using Apple's far-from-human-readable syntax.

Imagine doing this for each screen in your app, for multiple views. 

### Defining custom operators

It would be nice if we could add subviews to eac other easily. Let's define a custom operator for this purpose:

```swift

  infix operator +== // 1

  func +==(_ parent: UIView, _ child: UIView) { // 2
    parent.addSubview(child) // 3
  }

```

1. We define an infix operator, which means it goes between two oeprands. We choose *+==* as the operator symbol.
2. The oeprator implmeneation is a func which takes two arguments, *parent* as the left hand side argument, and *child* as the right hande side.
3. We add *child* as the parent sub view.

Now we can write:

```swift

  parent +== child1
  parent +== child2
  parent +== child3

```

Let's improve this operator even more. It would be nice if we can add all subviews in a single line rather then a separate line for every subview.

```swift

  precedencegroup UIViewAddSubviewPrecedence { // 1
    associativity: left
  }

  infix operator +==: UIViewAddSubviewPrecedence // 2
  @discardableResult // 3
  func +==(_ parent: UIView, _ child: UIView) -> UIView {
    parent.addSubview(child)
    return parent // 4
  }

```

1. We define a new precedence group, and define its associativity as *left*. This means that when the compiler has to evaluate multiple operators in sequence, it will go from left to right.
2. We conform to our new precedence group.
3. We mark the operator result as *@discardableResult*. This tells the compiler that the use of the operator result is not mandatory and eliminate warnings about not using it.
4. We return the parent as the opertor result.

Now we can write:

```swift

  parent +== child1 +== child2 +== child3

```

### Auto layout - give me some sugar

We still dind't solve the boiler plate code involved using auto layout constratins.
We will achieve it in two steps.
First step is to define a few helper fucntions to encapsualte the boiler plate code (and be able to forget about it alltogether :)).

```swift

extension UIView {
  
  func setHeight(_ height: CGFloat) {
    translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: height).isActive = true
  }
  
  func setWidth(_ width: CGFloat) {
    translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: width).isActive = true
  }
    
  func pinLeading(to view: UIView) {
    translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor).isActive = true
  }
  
  func pinTraling(to view: UIView) {
    translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
  }
    
  func pinTop(to view: UIView) {
    translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor).isActive = true
  }
}

```

We extend UIView and add multiple functions with a human readable syntax which defines layout constraints interanlly.

Next step we will define more custom opertors which will use these functions:

```swift

  infix operator |<- // pin to leading edge
  infix operator ->| // pin to trailing edge
  infix operator ^^ // pin to top
  infix operator ||| // set height
  infix operator --- // set width

  func |<-(_ lhs: UIView, _ rhs: UIView) {
    rhs.pinLeading(to: lhs)
  }

  func ->|(_ lhs: UIView, _ rhs: UIView) {
    lhs.pinTraling(to: rhs)
  }

  func ^^(_ lhs: UIView, _ rhs: UIView) {
    lhs.pinTop(to: rhs)
  }

  func |||(_ view: UIView, _ height: CGFloat) {
    view.setHeight(height)
  }

  func ---(_ view: UIView, _ width: CGFloat) {
    view.setWidth(width)
  }

```

And now we can do lots of view manipulations using our brand new operators:

```swift

  child1 ||| 50
  child1 --- 50
  child1 ->| parent
  child1 ^^ parent

  child2 ||| 30
  child2 --- 40
  child2 |<- parent
  child2 ^^ parent

  child3 ||| 20
  child3 ^^ parent
  child3 |<- parent
  child3 ->| parent

```

Pretty cool ðŸ˜Ž
